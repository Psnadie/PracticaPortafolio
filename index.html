                    Jacques Bermon Webster II was born on April 30, 1991, in Houston, Texas, spending his early years
                    in South Park where poverty and street life shaped his drive to succeed. Music ran in his blood,
                    his father was a soul musician and his grandfather a jazz composer. After briefly attending college,
                    Scott dropped out and bought a one-way ticket to New York City, pursuing his dream of becoming
                    a rapper despite his parents' disapproval.

                <div class="texto">
                    Scott's early career was marked by struggle as he slept on couches in New York, hustling for studio
                    time while his parents cut him off financially. His move to Los Angeles proved pivotal when his
                    track
                    "Lights (Love Sick)" caught T.I.'s attention, leading to a record deal with Grand Hustle. In 2012,
                    Kanye West signed him to GOOD Music, and his 2013 mixtape "Owl Pharaoh" established him
                    as a boundary-pushing innovator blending trap with indie influences.

                    Scott's 2015 debut "Rodeo" reached number three on the Billboard 200, while 2016's "Birds in the
                    Trap Sing McKnight" gave him his first number-one album. The game-changer came in 2018 with
                    "Astroworld," which produced his first chart-topping single "Sicko Mode" and accumulated over
                    10 billion streams. Beyond music, Scott became a cultural phenomenon with Nike collaborations
                    , a groundbreaking Fortnite concert, and luxury brand partnerships.

                    After a five-year hiatus following the 2021 Astroworld Festival tragedy, Scott returned in 2023 with
                    "Utopia," debuting at number one with hits like "Meltdown" and "Fein." Today, he stands as one of
                    hip-hop's most influential figures with five number-one Billboard hits and ten Grammy nominations.
                    His innovative blend of trap, rock, and psychedelia has inspired a new generation of artists and
                    left
                    an indelible mark on contemporary music culture.

                                    A homage to Travis's Houston roots, complete with amusement park visuals. 
                                    The album showcases his mastery of curation with intentional features, beat switches, 
                                    and transitions that set a new gold standard for psychedelic trap. Notable tracks include 
                                    "Stargazing," "Skeletons" with Tame Impala and The Weeknd, "Stop Trying To Be God", 
                                    and the introspective closer "Coffee Bean".

                                    Travis Scott's fourth studio album represents a bold artistic evolution, blending dystopian 
                                    themes with experimental production. The album features an impressive roster of collaborators 
                                    and showcases Travis's growth as both an artist and producer, pushing the boundaries of modern 
                                    hip-hop with atmospheric soundscapes and innovative beat construction.

                                    Travis Scott's debut studio album that established his signature sound. A raw and energetic 
                                    project that captures the wild, untamed spirit of his early career. Featuring hits like

                                    Travis Scott's second studio album delivers a darker, more introspective take on his signature 
                                    sound. The project explores themes of success, fame, and the pressures that come with it. 
                                    With standout tracks like "Pick Up The Phone," "Goosebumps," and "Coordinate," the album 
                                    solidified Travis's position as one of hip-hop's most innovative voices.
